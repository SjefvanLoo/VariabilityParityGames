	abstract = "Family-based model checking targets the simultaneous verfication of multiple system variants, a technique to handle feature-based variability that is intrinsic to software product lines (SPLs). We present an approach for family-based verification based on the feature μ-calculus μLf, which combines modalities with feature expressions. This logic is interpreted over featured transition systems, a well-accepted model of SPLs, which allows one to reason over the collective behavior of a number of variants (a family of products). Via an embedding into the modal μ-calculus with data, underpinned by the general-purpose mCRL2 toolset, off-the-shelf tool support for μLf becomes readily available. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach on an SPL benchmark model and show the runtime improvement that family-based model checking with mCRL2 offers with respect to model checking the benchmark product-by-product.",

	abstract = "We introduce a fundamental propositional logical system based on modal logic for describing correctness, termination and equivalence of programs. We define a formal syntax and semantics for the propositional dynamic logic of regular programs and give several consequences of the definition. Principal conclusions are that deciding satisfiability of length n formulas requires time dn/logn for some d > 1, and that satisfiability can be decided in nondeterministic time cn for some c. We provide applications of the decision procedure to regular expressions, Ianov schemes, and classical systems of modal logic."

This problem is motivated by applications to finite automata on infinite trees. A special attention is given to the exact amount of memory needed by the players for their winning strategies. Based on a previous work of Gurevich and Harrington and on subsequent improvements of McNaughton we propose a unique framework that allows to reestablish and to improve various results concerning memoryless strategies due to Emerson and Jutla, Mostowski, Klarlund."
