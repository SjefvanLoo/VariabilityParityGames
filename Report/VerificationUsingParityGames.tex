\subsubsection{FTSs and parity games}
Using the theory we have seen thus far we can verify FTSs by verifying every projection of the FTS to a valid product. This relation is depicted in the following diagram where $\Pi$ indicates a projection:
\\\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=4em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
{
	\text{FTS} \\
	\text{LTS} & \text{PG} \\};
\path[-stealth]
(m-1-1) edge [double] node [left] {$\Pi$} (m-2-1)
(m-2-1.east|-m-2-2) edge node [above] {$\varphi$}
(m-2-2)
;
\end{tikzpicture}\\
As mentioned before verifying products dependently is potentially more efficient. In the next two sections we define an extension to parity games, namely \textit{variability parity games} (VPGs) which can be used to verify an FTS. We will translate an FTS and a formula into a VPG which solution will provide the information needed to conclude for which products the FTS satisfies the formula.
