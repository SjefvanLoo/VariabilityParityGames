The algorithms proposed to solve VPGs collectively have the same or a worse time complexity than the independent approach. The aim of the collective algorithms is to solve VPGs effectively when there are a lot of commonalities between configurations. A worst-case time complexity analyses does not say much about the performance in case there are many commonalities. In order to evaluate actual running time on different types of VPGs the algorithms are implemented and a number of test VPGs are created to test the performance on. In this next few sections we discuss the implementation and look at the results.
