The algorithms proposed to solve VPGs don't have a better worst case running time complexity, generally speaking this is the case because the projections of the VPG might have very little in common. However the aim of the algorithms is to solve VPGs effectively when there are commonalities. In order to evaluate the performance of the algorithms when there are commonalities the algorithms are implemented and ran on a number of VPG test sets. In this part we discuss the implementation and look at the results.
