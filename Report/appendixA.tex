\begin{theorem}
	\label{theA_solve_UVPG_is_solve_VPG}
	Given VPG $\hat{G} =  (\hat{V},\hat{V}_0,\hat{V}_1, \hat{E},\hat{\Omega}, \mathfrak{C},\theta)$. For winning sets $W_0$ and $W_1$ for game $\hat{G}_{\downarrow}$ and winning sets $\hat{W}^c_0$ and $\hat{W}^c_1$ for some configuration $c \in \mathfrak{C}$ it holds that
	\[(c,\hat{v}) \in W_\alpha \iff \hat{v} \in \hat{W}^c_\alpha  \text{, for }\alpha \in \{0,1\}  \]
	\begin{proof}
		The bi-implication is equal to  the following to implications.
		\[ (c,\hat{v}) \in W_\alpha \implies \hat{v} \in \hat{W}^c_\alpha  \text{, for }\alpha \in \{0,1\} \]
		and
		\[ (c,\hat{v}) \notin W_\alpha\implies \hat{v} \notin \hat{W}^c_\alpha \text{, for }\alpha \in \{0,1\}  \]
		
		Since the winning sets partition the game we have $\hat{v} \notin \hat{W}^c_\alpha \implies \hat{v} \in \hat{W}^c_{\overline{\alpha}}$ (similar for set $W$). Therefore it is sufficient to prove the first implication.
		
		Let $(c,\hat{v}) \in W_\alpha$, player $\alpha$ has a strategy to win game $\hat{G}_{\downarrow}$ from vertex $(c,\hat{v})$. Since $\hat{G}_{\downarrow}$ is the union of all the projections of $\hat{G}$ we can apply the same strategy to game $\hat{G}_{|c}$ to win vertex $\hat{v}$ as player $\alpha$. Because we can win $\hat{v}$ in the projection of $\hat{G}$ to $c$ we have $\hat{v} \in \hat{W}^c_\alpha$.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lem_md_ineq}
	For $d,m \in \mathbb{N}$ with $d>1$ and $m \geq 0$ the following inequality holds:
	\[ (m+d-1)^d + m+1 \leq (m+d)^d \]
	\begin{proof}
		We expand the inequality.
		\begin{align*}
		(m+d-1)^d + m + 1 & \leq (m+d)^d\\
		(m+d-1)(m+d-1)^{d-1} + m + 1 & \leq (m+d)(m+d)^{d-1}\\
		m(m+d-1)^{d-1} + d(m+d-1)^{d-1} - (m+d-1)^{d-1} + m + 1 & \leq m(m+d)^{d-1} + d(m+d)^{d-1}
		\end{align*}
		Since $d > 1$ and $m \geq 0$ we can see that the left hand term $m(m+d-1)^{d-1}$ is less or equal to the right hand term $m(m+d)^{d-1}$, similarly the left hand term $d(m+d-1)^{d-1}$ is less or equal to the right hand term $d(m+d)^{d-1}$. Finally the term $(m+d-1)^{d-1} \geq (m+1)^{d-1} \geq m+1$ and therefore $- (m+d-1)^{d-1} + m + 1  \leq 0$. This proves the lemma.
	\end{proof}
